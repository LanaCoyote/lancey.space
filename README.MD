# lancey.space

This repo contains the code for my personal site, [lancey.space](http://lancey.space/) (sans the settings file and other information).

lancey.space is intended to be an [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com) compliant blog site. Therefore, this repo will have a bunch of (poorly written) code for getting django to work with various indieweb functions such as [webmentions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention) and [POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE). I'll be adding these features over time.

So far the site has:

 * [IndieAuth implementation](https://indiewebcamp.com/IndieAuth)
 * [h-entry markup](https://indiewebcamp.com/h-entry) on posts
 * [h-card markup](https://indiewebcamp.com/h-card) for contact information
 * Basic back/forward navigation between posts
 * Support for articles, notes, and replies
 * [Web sign-in support](https://indiewebcamp.com/Web_sign-in)
